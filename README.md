# Usage

1.  Place STREAMS.DAT and ASSETS.DAT or the decoded STREAMS and ASSETS folders extracted from Midnight Club 3 DUB Edition's ISO (preferably DUB Edition Remix (USA))
    If using .DAT files, run the script first to decode them.

2.  Place new music files in STREAMS/Music/[genre] with the format [Artist] - [Song].[ext] 
    If there is (feat.) or (ft.) in the song's name, it will automatically be added to [Artist]

3.  Run the script if you haven't already.

4.  Follow the instructions in the command line.

5.  Encode STREAMS.DAT and ASSETS.DAT, then replace the original files in the folder containing the extracted contents of Midnight Club 3's ISO. 
    Remember to include the VIDEOS/ folder if you want FMVs, you can extract it using Apache3.
    Burn the folder contents into an ISO (you can use ImgBurn for this)
